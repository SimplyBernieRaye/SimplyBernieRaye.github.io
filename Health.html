Health and Wellness while Gaming <br>
Article link: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspor.2021.693700/full">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspor.2021.693700/full</a> Links to an external site. <br>
1. The article discusses the health risks the majority of gamers and esports players face, as well as how keeping healthy habits and a normal exercise routine could lessen these risks.  Because they experience high amounts of physical activity and sedentary behavior, esports players are at high risk of suffering from non-communicable diseases and early death.  The article also promotes using digital technology for promoting healthy habits; sleep and heart rate trackers can bring awareness to the health of many gamers.  Focusing on getting better sleep, a good diet, and regular exercise can contribute to improving the health and mental well being of a multitude of gamers.<br>
2. My most healthiest habit is drinking water.  I *occasionally* lift weights and work out, but I skip leg day every day.  Other than that, I have a terrible sleep schedule and diet; I often skip meals because of a fast-paced schedule.
<br>3. I would say incorporating physical activity into my gaming sessions would be helpful!  I have a VR headset at home and played BeatSaber prior to this school year; I think playing games that require movement will help improve my health.
<br>4. It is important to know about these things when thinking about joining the esports field because, just like any job, it is important to prioritize one's own health.  Lacking in physical, mental, or emotional well-being can lead to fatigue, depression, or even worse.  Being on top of your health can help you perform in games better!

		  PC Gaming Health <br>
		  1. Respond: After gaming for a long period of time, what feels tired? Eyes, hands, mind, wrists, neck, etc. What can you do differently to alleviate pain or tiredness when gaming? <br>
		  After gaming for a long period time, my eyes feel tired, my shoulders are in pain, and my wrists feel tired.  After the adrenaline from gaming wears out, my mind feels exhausted and I am unable to do anything productive afterwards.  I think taking breaks, having a proper posture, and doing stretches between matches for games would help alleviate some pain and tiredness when gaming. <br>
		  2. Read this article:  Exercises for Wrist Pain <br>
		  The article details a variety of wrist stretches to help relieve wrist pain.  These include wrist circles, wrist rotations, wrist flexor stretches, and prayer stretches.  These stretches help exercise your wrist and improve their flexibility. <br>
		  From this article, I could follow the instructions on several stretches and incorporate them into my gaming sessions!  Whether I am dying in league of legends, or I need to take a break, I can do some wrist stretches to relieve some stress and pain! <br>

		  I learned that gamers can be at risk for carpal tunnel if wrist issues and pain occurs.  Carpal tunnel can result in less dexterity and a weaker grip.  Doing 5-10 minute breaks while gaming can help reduce this risk! </p>

     	    There are some ways to mitigate the negative impacts that are presented: as shown in the article, debunking politicians and organizations for their false claims about video games is a place to start.  Educating the public, fellow gamers, and parents about gaming in moderation as well as spreading awareness about gun violence can help too.
Lastly, to put it bluntly, if you want to reduce gun violence, you should take out the source-- put up more gun laws and restrictions.</p>
		<p style="background-color: !important background-color: inherit; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: inherit; padding-left: 5px;">While this article has a good introduction, it does little to back up its point; it does better at summarizing than arguing that video games do not play into shootings and acts of violence.  First, it introduces the reader to how politicians, such as Donald Trump, would often blame video games for the increase in mass shootings.  The article describes how the APA released a statement with false information that painted video games in a bad light; scholars later corrected the organization for this.  
The author's only strong point to support his argument was in his self-research claims, as he is a professor of psychology at Stetson University.</p>

			<tr> <th> Games that help me relax when I'm stressed:</th></tr>
		    <tr>
			    <th>Splatoon 3- I find only certain game modes in Splatoon 3 relaxing.  These include Table Turf and Salmon Run!  They have less of a competitive aspect to them, so I find them relaxing. Table Turf is extremely simple, and I can play it when I'm on a tight schedule.  I can also take out the frustrations of my day on Salmonoids if I'm every feeling stressed! 

</th>
			    <th>Nier: Automata- This game has a mix of action, but it is accompanied with a beautiful soundtrack and visuals.  The enemies Oftentimes, I love exploring the scenery while doing side quests.  Everything is so immersive, contributing to a relaxing gaming experience.
</th>
				<th>Beatsaber- Although I'm not a great dancer, I love to play Beatsaber!  I'm bad at exercising or keeping a consistent workout routine, so this game helps me stay fit!  I also enjoy the selection of free music they have, especially KDA: Popstars!  I get an adrenaline rush while playing this game, but once it wears off, I'm relaxed.
