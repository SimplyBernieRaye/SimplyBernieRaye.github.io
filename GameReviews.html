  As a fan of RPGs and anime, Genshin Impact for sure caught my attention! I first played the game during its launch release and was fascinated by its fluid combat system and beautiful graphics. For a free-to-download game, this was surely impressive. Unfortunately, over time, the gameplay, quests, and missions grew too repetitive for me. Everything was focused on grinding, improving characters, and being forced to level up in order to enjoy events. The game grew boring for me, and I stopped playing it for months. Nevertheless, I admire its animation, character designs, and soundtrack.<br><img src="images/Screen Shot 2023-05-03 at 12.55.40 PM.png" width="391" height="228" alt="" align="center"/></p>

        <i>Game: Nier Automata </i><br>
		  <br>
        Humanity &amp; existentialism. Life &amp; death. These are a few of the many heavy theme Nier: Automata tackles in its story. What first drew me into the game was its beautiful soundtrack. I even remember the song that introduced me to this series: "Song of the Ancients". Before I knew it, I watched video essays and did research into this game's lore as a source of comfort during my junior year of high school. This is something I regret doing because this game's story is absolutely stunning; it is worth it to go into this game blind of its plotline. The characters, animation, dialogue, and combat system are fantastic. Nier: Automata is a game I hold close to my heart. After going through all of the main endings (A, B, C, D, and E) and ultimately losing all of my save files to achieve this, I give my gratitude to Yoko Taro and the team behind this game. Nier: Automata taught me that I choose to live my life. "A future is given not given to you. It is something you must take for yourself."
