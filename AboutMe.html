<p style="background-color: !important background-color: inherit; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: inherit; margin-right: nanpx; margin-left: 0px;"><b>The Beginnings:</b><br>
  "Hey, Ate Bernadette, look at this game I'm playing!" my cousin, Lorenzo, beamed brightly while tinkering with his tablet. I leaned towards him and watched closely; cute cartoon monsters were fighting each other on the screen, in a similar fashion to Pokemon. The game he was playing was called MinoMonsters. He handed me the tablet and let me play; I was instantly hooked. The game animations were smooth, the gameplay was fun, and all of the monster designs were cool! Five-year-old me could not believe something like this existed! I immediately downloaded the game on my Mom's IPad and set a goal to capture all of the elemental legendary monsters. MinoMonsters was one of my first experiences into video games, and it set the standard for what I expected from video games for years to come. This in fact, was a low standard, as I would later discover that there would be a great variety of games, genres, and different styles that the video gaming world would offer me.<br> 	As I was growing up, Nintendo played a large role in my childhood.  It brought me closer to my family members, entertained me, and fostered my love for my interests, such as dinosaurs and puppies.  My first official gaming console was the Nintendo DSI.  While my mom went shopping at the mall, I would be absorbed by the games I played on this little device.  I vaguely remember what I played, but I know for sure my most favorite game involved dinosaur battles.  Fun fact, I was an apatosaurus main, since herbivores had high defense stats!

		<p style="background-color: !important background-color: inherit; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: inherit;">	Even as I was moving up from middle school and onto high school, my cousins still played a large role in my gaming life. And what a surprise, they forced me to play League of Legends!  Now, why would they introduce me to a trashy game with a toxic fanbase and a cash-greedy gaming company?  Well, we were just kids who wanted to play together.  While League of Legends was extremely hard to understand at first, I slowly but surely found myself getting obsessed with the game.  This especially happened when I paid attention to Riot's way of designing League's champions; the art behind this game was amazing!  My first mains were Kindred, Sett, and Aphelios; I loved Kindred's and Aphelios's complicated kits, but at times I favored Sett's simplicity.  (I mean hey, being a muscular guy with abs who punches people is fun.) I eventually found my role when I was complaining about my cousin Ben's gaming skills.  I made fun of him for being "a bad support", as we duo-laned with me as Aphelios and him as Yuumi.  Ben dared me, "Well, Ate, if you say I'm a bad support, why don't you play Yuumi instead?"  He suggested that we both swap roles and champions. I accepted his challenge and ended up proving to be the better support.  Our cousin Lorenzo roasted him, saying, "I think Ate is better at support than you, Ben."  From here on out, I become a support main, with Rakan being my most favorite champion in the role! <br> 	Despite being unranked, I have learned from League of Legends that sometimes, you just have to take a break from gaming.  Facing a five-loss streak in your matches is not the best feeling, but it isn't something that should completely ruin your week.  Being insulted by teammates all day grew tiring, and at some point, I did not have time for league because of academic work.  I learned the hard way that binge gaming and being stressed about a video game is not worth it.  Thus, League of Legends has changed my perspective on games.

 I am sure any gamer must have heard of this Nintendo console: the Wii!  As a kid, I enjoyed playing a variety of games on this console, such as Just Dance, Wii Sports, and the Mii Channel!  I would play these games with my friends and family.  Thanks to the Wii, my childhood was pretty fun!
While I could ramble on about the memories made while playing Wii Sports and me raging over Wii boxing, I would like to mention a franchise that incredibly shaped my gaming life.  This was Skylanders!  I was in awe when I first saw Skylanders toys in Best Buy while shopping with my mom.  One Skylander was a dragon made out of pink crystals, while the other was also a dragon with dark purple themes to it; as a dragon lover, I could not resist getting these!  I begged my mom to buy the two toys, and later on I bought the game Skylanders: Giants. <br> Skylanders was an absolute game changer for me.  This franchise helped me love console gaming.  Inserting the disk into the Wii and then seeing the Skylanders screen boot up was exhilirating.  I loved exploring Skylands, and I grew close to the Skylander characters.  Captain Flynn and Callie will always be in my memories, along with Kaos, the humorous villain, and his cynical henchman, Glumshanks.  Throughout 2nd and 4th grade, I was absolutely in love with and invested in Skylanders.  To this day, I am glad I got to experience many of the series' most amazing games, including Skylanders: Swap Force and Skylanders: Trap Team.

			<tr> <th> The Present: What games do I currently like?</th></tr>
		    <tr>
			    <th>Splatoon 2: As of now, I am on my way to finishing the Octo Expansion DLC for Splatoon 2!  It brings many fun challenges and is more difficult than the main story campaign.  The soundtrack, animation, and the creativity that goes into this game deserves an applause.  I absolutely adore the game's idols: Pearl and Marina!  Splatoon 2 is casual-friendly, and I enjoy it on my weekends or days where I have plenty of time off.
</th>
			    <th>Plants Vs. Zombies: Gaming during a busy school year can be tough, and that is why I play casual games like Plants Vs. Zombies!  It has a good balance of strategy and simplicity.  Whether you need a quick gaming session or just a time spender, Plants Vs. Zombies is a fun game to play!  I play Plants Vs. Zombies and Plants Vs. Zombies 2 nearly daily; it fits perfectly with my tight schedule.  Playing around with different plants and their specialties is entertaining!</th>
				<th>Nier: Automata: I have recently achieved endings A, B, C, D, and E for this game!  Although I had to erase all of my save files to accomplish this, it was absolutely worth it.  Nier: Automata gave me a wonderfully crafted story.  It has influenced me as a gamer, musician, and artist to this day.

			<tr> <th> The Future: What games do I look forward to?</th></tr>
		    <tr>
			    <th>Splatoon 3:&nbsp;As a Splatoon veteran, I am greatly looking forward to this sequel to Splatoon 2! The new weapons look cool, the soundtrack for the testfire is amazing, and the new idol group is just outstanding! I love how they implemented the theme of chaos as a boiling pot of cultures, as illustrated through Splatoon 3's idol group Deep Cut! The trio have Brazilian, Japanese, Indian, and Middle Eastern cultural influences. Splatoon 3 releases this year on September 9th!
              </th>
			    <th>Bayonetta 3:&nbsp; It's witch time! Although I have never played the previous Bayonetta games, I am already looking forward to Bayonetta 3! As an artist looking to practice character design, Bayonetta's personality, outfit, and overall design charmed me when I first saw her in Super Smash Bros 4. After seeing the trailers, I feel like Bayonetta 3 will be quite the ride, with its fast-paced combat, energetic soundtrack, and mature themes. Bayonetta 3 is set to come out on October 28th of this year!</th>
				<th>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild was an absolute masterpiece; it was one of my first experiences into open world gaming. The combat was fluid and strategic, the animation style was aesthetically pleasing, and the main characters were fun to hang around! With how great the first game was, I wonder how Nintendo will top it off in their sequel! I have high expectations for this game, but I already feel like it will be another masterpiece. This game is estimated to be released in the year 2023!
