Whether it is storytelling, gameplay mechanics, art, or even animation, these aspects tie together in what is called “video games”. Impressive graphics and animation can draw in an audience, while a good story can keep players hooked. For instance, a game could transport you into a fantasy world, a futuristic dystopia, or even the past. They are a form of escapism; they can bring excitement and new experiences into a mundane, modern world. &nbsp;</p>

   	Sam Von Ehren, a Game Maker for The New York Times delves into the simple reason why people love games: they are fun! What is even more interesting is that this is a paradox; video games provide freedom that is being controlled by rules. Video games challenge one to make choices under specific circumstances; the author uses “Rock, Paper, Scissors” as an example. Ehren interacts with the audience and (if they responded to his game challenge) reveals how games entice us into a voluntary conflict governed by a set of rules. He calls this phenomenon “the magic circle”. Video games allow us to explore realities with believable rules, yet they still give us experiences of having fun.</p>

        <i>Prompt: Why are video games and games in general so powerful a factor in society? (Why are they so influential?) </i><br>
		  <br>
        Video games, and games in general, are so influential in our society because they are an art form. Similar to music and art, they can impact us in many ways, whether it is emotionally or even mentally. A video game’s soundtrack can uplift the player, its animation can leave them in awe, and its ultimate message can change their life forever. Some video games, just like Plants Vs. Zombies (the game I played today) can just be casual games played for fun; on the other hand, games like Nier: Automata can bring hard-hitting life lessons towards the player. It’s a game that speaks about humanity; its world is cruel, but humanity still lives on-- if you choose to do so.</p>
